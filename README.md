# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the presence of **heart disease** in patients based on clinical attributes. It involves end-to-end implementation of machine learning techniques with proper preprocessing, class balancing using SMOTE, and comparative evaluation of multiple classifiers.
